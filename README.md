# Project Name:
External User Experience Intelligence
# Sponsor:
Bank of America Business Unit
# Objective:
The goal of this project is to identify and analyze different external signals not limited to posts, blogs,
news etc. to monitor customer feedback, discover correlated insights from external signals about
service performance and predict likely steps for improving customer satisfaction.
# Narrative:
Business services have increasing dependency on external user experience and service availability
indicators to alert them to potential service disruption. It would be beneficial to automate these
monitoring activities (using NLP techniques, cause effect relation, etc.) and be informed of likely steps
to take based on customer feedback, reports, complaints from external signals.
# Problem Statement:
â€¢ Develop a model for monitoring customer feedback, reports, complaints based on external
signals (posts, blogs, etc.), provide correlated insights from external signals about service
performance and predict likely steps for improving customer satisfaction.
# Risks:
The project requiresstudents to access external user reports, service availability indicators, and
historical data to build correlated insights and predictive model. Students would need to work towards
getting required access and evaluate open source tools to ensure use of accurate data sets, maintained
packages/APIs etc. for the project.
# Dependencies:
The project depends on access to tools to gather external customer experience data. Building a
predictive model depends on finding accurate and sufficient historical data.
# Boundaries:
Using external monitoring signals from at least 2 different sources (posts, blogs, news, etc.) for
analyzing customer feedback and providing correlated insights. Development of predictive model or
analysis of historical data for improving customer satisfaction, service performance, etc. based on
historical data.
Integrating alerting mechanism based on thresholds is out of scope. User interactions beyond selecting
state, city, timeframe, and service categories are out of scope.
# Project Deliverables:
1. Workflow/process for continuously monitoring customer experience, reports, complaints and
providing correlated insights from external signals about service performance
2. UI for navigating the results.
# Project Assumptions:
We should be following standard coding practices which BofA can leverage if they choose to.
The sponsor wants the team to have adequate knowledge of python programing, using different
libraries/packages and NLP tools.
We expect to be in communication with the sponsors
